## Installation

I've created this theme entirely for use on my own blog. I provide no guarantees it will work for you, nor any support if it doesn't.

If you would like to play around with this theme, the installation instructions on the [Apollo repository](https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo) upstream might help.

If you would like a theme with community support, I would recommend choosing something else.

## Configuration

Checkout all the [options you can configure](./content/posts/configuration.md) and the [example pages](./content/posts/).
