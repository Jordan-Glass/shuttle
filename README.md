## Licensing

This theme is licensed under MIT, the text of which is available in the `LICENSE` file. This is because it is forked from Apollo, which is licensed under MIT.

This excludes content in `static/fonts`. Archivo, Cascadia Code and Oswald are licensed under the OFL. The text of this is available in each font folder.

## Installation

I've created this theme entirely for use on my own blog. I will make changes exclusively for my own needs, which may not be the same as yours.

I provide no guarantees this theme will work for you, nor any support if it doesn't. This is broadly what the [MIT license](./LICENSE) declares, and you should ensure you are comfortable with its terms before you use this theme.

If you would like to play around with this theme, the installation instructions on the [Apollo repository](https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo) upstream might help.

If you would like a theme with community support, I would recommend choosing something else.
